# ConformanceClient

This directory contains an executable which can be invoked by the
[Connect conformance runner](https://github.com/connectrpc/conformance)
which performs a matrix of hundreds of runtime tests against a local
server in order to validate library behaviors with various permutations of
protocols, codecs, etc.

Refer to the [contributing guide](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests)
for details on how to run these tests with the runner.
